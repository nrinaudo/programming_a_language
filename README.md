# Programming a language

Demo repository for [this series of articles](https://nrinaudo.com/articles/pl.html).

Each module is the full implementation of one of the topics covered in the articles:
- operational semantics in `untyped`.
- type checking in `type_checking`.
- type inference in `type_inference` (and a pure version in `type_inference_state`).
- typed ASTs in `typed_ast`.
- typed ASTs that encode the environment at the type level in `typed_env`.
